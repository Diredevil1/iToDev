# React + TypeScript = iToDev Homework

Intro note:
I'm well aware it's not perfect, far from it, from the ui and flows to code structure, loaders, and redundant code - everything can be improved ^^

Tried to make it as simple as possible, using some new tools that I never used(tanstack query, base ui), both amazing libraries, that I will sure will be following going forward,
also dont mind the fact that I used only 1 component form base ui, its tree shakable so it should be fine!

I'm not sure what else to add, of course if any question let me know, and I will be eagerly waiting for the feedback!
